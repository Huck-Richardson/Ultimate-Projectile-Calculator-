# Ultimate-Projectile-Calculator-
An Open Source Theoretical Projectile Calculator
This calculator is  accurate to about 2-3 feet
THIS IS THE BETA VERSION. THERE MAY BE BUGS, OR IT MIGHT NOT RUN BECUASE OF ERRORS

Helpful Tips
1.Average Air Density at Sea Level = 1.225 kg/m
2.Average Aceleration due to Gravity = 9.8 m/s
3.Weight of a Baseball = 0.14 kilograms
4.Cross Sectional Area of a Baseball = 0.01 meters
5.Power Output =  10 kilowatts per kilogram for normal person 20 for a pro athlete
6.When in doubt, Google
7.If you want to contiue theoretically throwing things see the Starting Screen
8.REMEMBER! Always enter things in LOWERCASE.
9.You need the Idle shell to run this program. If you don't have it you should get it.
10.If theres a bug you should report it and wait for a bix fix
11.You can change the units from meters per second (mps) to mph in settings
12.Quit will kill the program

Not So Helpful tips
1.If you want to see how far you can throw something on another planet see below.
Mars: Acceleration due to Gravity = 3.7 mps | Atmospheric density = 0.02 kg/m
Venus: Acceleration due to Gravity = 8.87 mps | Atmospheric density = 67 kg/m
Jupiter (troposphere): Acceleration due to Gravity = 24.5 mps | Atmospheric density = 101971.6 kg/m
Dagobah: Acceleration due to Gravity = 8.83 mps | Atmospheric density = 1.225 kg/m
